**Lecture 3: Cryptography**

> Understand several methods of symmetric key cryptography, public key (asymmetric) key cryptography on a high (math-free) level. Focus on the pros & cons of each method. (ex. Why this mechanism is brute-force free? Why we won't adapt this brute-force free approach?)

In **public-key (asymmetric) cryptography**, a secret key isn't shared. Instead, a set of **public values** is used. The public values are then combined with **private, hidden variables** to create an identical shared key.
