***2 sum***
***3 sum***
***4 sum***
- quadruplet is exsit for sure
- same element can't repeat in the result list

the brute force approach for this question would be, pick every four elements in this array to form a quadruplet. That would be the quatric level for the time complexity, for sure we don't want that
